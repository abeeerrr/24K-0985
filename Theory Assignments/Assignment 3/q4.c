q4: You are creating a system to track employee performance ratings over multiple evaluation periods.
The system will dynamically allocate memory to store ratings and perform various analysis tasks,
including finding the top-performing employee and the best-rated evaluation period.
Define the Employee Structure:
Create a structure called Employee with the following fields:
? ratings: A dynamically allocated array to store the ratings for each evaluation period.
? totalScore: An integer to store the employee's total score across all evaluation periods.
Define the following function:
1. Input Ratings Function:
? Implement a function void inputEmployees(int** ratings, int numEmployees, int
numPeriods) to allow the user to enter ratings for each employee across all
evaluation periods.
? Each rating should be between 1 and 10 (inclusive). Input validation should be
implemented to enforce this.
2. Display Performance Function:
? Implement a function void displayPerformance(int** ratings, int numEmployees,
int numPeriods) that displays the performance ratings for each employee across all
evaluation periods.

3. Find Employee of the Year Function:
? Implement a function int findEmployeeOfTheYear(int** ratings, int
numEmployees, int numPeriods) to calculate and return the index of the employee
with the highest average rating.
4. Find Highest Rated Period Function:
? Implement a function int findHighestRatedPeriod(int** ratings, int
numEmployees, int numPeriods) to calculate and return the evaluation period with
the highest average rating across all employees.

5. Find Worst Performing Employee Function:
? Implement a function int findWorstPerformingEmployee(int** ratings, int
numEmployees, int numPeriods) to calculate and return the index of the employee
with the lowest average rating.

Memory Management:
? Dynamically allocate memory for each employee's ratings based on the number of
evaluation periods.
? After completing all tasks, ensure that the dynamically allocated memory is properly freed to
prevent memory leaks.
